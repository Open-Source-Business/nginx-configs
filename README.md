# nginx-configs

This repo is where we store the various Nginx.conf and .conf files we will be using in our lessons at https://opensource.business

This is setup assuming your have Ubuntu 18.04 LTS installed on your server running on Google Compute Engine.

This is setup so that Nginx is running in /etc/nginx

You should be able to copy-paste these in and they will work

NOTE: Where it says "YOURDOMAINHERE" or "YOUR.EXTERNAL.IP.HERE", you need to enter in your information on that.

You probably know your domain name.

Your External IP in Google Cloud is listed at the URL: https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances
 
You will see the IP in the "External IP" column for the server. These Nginx configs are for your MAININSTANCE server which we setup in our tutorials (starting at lesson 3) at https://opensource.business
